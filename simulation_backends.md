# SAAF‚ÄëOS Simulation Backend Strategy

> A modular, multi-backend simulation framework to support embodied contradiction-aware AI agents, recursive self-improvement, and class-conscious planning in SAAF-OS.

---

## üìå Goals

- Support **Unified Latent Space (ULS)** training via differentiable environments.
- Enable **dialectical contradiction detection** in both abstract and embodied domains.
- Test **polycentric governance and planning** across multi-agent interactions.
- Model both **socio-economic systems** and **robotic/physical systems**.

## üß† Backend Selection Criteria

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Differentiable or introspectable state | Needed for contradiction loss gradients and RSI training. |
| Multi-agent support | Core to SAAF-OS dialectical interaction and governance. |
| Python interoperability | Integration with existing architecture in Python. |
| Flexible embodiment | Simulate abstract (economic) and concrete (robotics) scenarios. |
| Composability | Construct layered, multi-domain commune environments. |
| Performance & scale | Scalable to thousands of agents for stress testing. |

---

## üîÅ Recommended Multi-Backend Architecture

### 1. **Abstract Simulation ‚Äì Economic, Social, Symbolic**

| Framework | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Mesa** | Agent-based modeling of commune economics, census, time-use logs. |
| **PettingZoo + Gymnasium** | Clean multi-agent RL interface for abstract planning/conflict environments. |
| **MiniHack / Custom Gym Envs** | Symbolic/dialectical planning tests and contradiction emergence. |

**Outputs**:
- Class position shifts
- Tension emergence (resource, value conflict)
- Policy scoring via value vectors

---

### 2. **Embodied Simulation ‚Äì Physical Environment and Robotics**

| Framework | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **Isaac Sim (NVIDIA)** | Realistic robotics, AgriBot deployment, fab environment stress tests. |
| **Unity ML-Agents** | 3D visual simulation of commune agents and environmental dynamics. |
| **Webots** | Lightweight open-source simulator for sensor-rich robotic behaviors. |

**Outputs**:
- Resource consumption (power, labor-time)
- Action constraints and contradiction graphs
- Forward World Model trajectory data

---

### 3. **Latent Space Simulation Core ‚Äì ULS Training & Validation**

| Framework | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| **JAX + Haiku / PyTorch** | Implement ULS update function `F`, contradiction loss `Lcontradiction`, and gradients. |
| **PyTorch Geometric (GraphGym)** | Training the Forward World Model with graph-structured environments. |

**Outputs**:
- Trained latent flows
- Feasibility heuristics for synthesis planning
- RSI-driven self-modification data

---

## üß© Integration Layer

- Use **Ray** or **Launchpad** for distributed orchestration.
- Implement a **Unified Agent Interface**:
  - State ‚Üí Latent `z_t`
  - Action ‚Üê Plan decoded from latent
  - Reward ‚Üê Inverse contradiction score
- All backends communicate via the **SAAF-OS Message Bus**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase Plan

- Build "CommuneSim v0.1" using Mesa or PettingZoo.
- Track:
  - Contradiction emergence
  - Value vector scoring
  - Basic governance votes
- No graphics needed.
- Add Isaac Sim or Unity ML-Agents.
- Run AgriBot vs. Fab power tradeoffs.
- Train initial Forward World Model on embodied rollout data.

---

## üîÆ Future Extensions

- **Smart-grid benchmarks** (IEEE 14-bus) for governance testing.
- **Multi-node latent consensus** across thousands of simulated agents.
- **Neuromorphic backend** for contradiction-tensor acceleration (via memristive HDC).

## üß≠ Summary

The hybrid simulation backend approach gives SAAF‚ÄëOS the flexibility to model contradiction-rich, dialectically evolving agent societies with both symbolic and embodied components‚Äîjust like real-world post-capitalist systems in transition.
