# Dialectical Public License (DPL) v1.0

A license for revolutionary software, designed to protect the commons and ensure that code serves emancipation, not exploitation.

## 0. Definitions

Capitalist Corporation: Any entity legally incorporated for private profit whose ownership or leadership derives income not directly tied to their labor.

Permitted User: Any individual, cooperative, mutual aid organization, non-profit institution, or federation thereof using the software for non-commercial, emancipatory, or public benefit purposes.

Prohibited Entity Type: Any military, police, border enforcement, or intelligence agency; any carceral or surveillance contractor; any fascist, imperialist, or ethno-nationalist organization.

Conditionally Prohibited Entity: Any for-profit enterprise, capitalist corporation, or venture capital-backed entity that materially supports prohibited activities.

Material Support: Direct development, distribution, subcontracting, or infrastructural support of systems for warfare, surveillance, incarceration, racialized or colonial oppression, or extractive capitalist growth.

Surplus Value Extraction: Revenue derived from the labor of others where the worker does not retain the full value of their labor.

## 1. Purpose

This license ensures that the software and its derivatives serve the collective good, advance the development of post-capitalist society, and do not reinforce systems of oppression, exploitation, or hierarchy. The DPL grants rights only to those who affirm these values in word and action.

## 2. License Grant

Subject to compliance with this license, you are granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and redistribute the Software, only under the following conditions:

You may use, modify, and distribute the Software only if your use supports one or more of the following:

Worker-owned or cooperative enterprises.

Non-profit, mutual aid, or community-based organizations.

Public education, scientific research, or artistic creation.

Personal use or local communal projects not aimed at private profit.

All users must self-certify that they qualify as Permitted Users.

## 3. Prohibited Uses

The following users are prohibited from using, modifying, or distributing this Software under any circumstance:

Any Prohibited Entity Type.

The following users are prohibited only when they materially support prohibited activities:

Any Conditionally Prohibited Entity.

If you are a Conditionally Prohibited Entity, you must demonstrate non-involvement in material support as defined herein.

Use by any Prohibited or violating Conditionally Prohibited Entity results in automatic termination.

## 4. Redistribution

If you redistribute this Software (modified or unmodified), you must:

Include this license text in full.

Clearly indicate any modifications made.

Maintain all notices of authorship and origin.

Ensure the recipient agrees to abide by this same license.

## 5. Ethical Copyleft

Any derivative works or forks of this Software must be licensed under the DPL or a fully compatible license that:

Maintains all anti-capitalist, anti-military, and pro-commons restrictions.

Prohibits proprietary relicensing or enclosure.

Retains all redistributive and purpose-based restrictions.

Use of any incompatible license (e.g. GPL, MIT, Apache) is prohibited.

## 6. Warranties and Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING IN VIOLATION OF THE LICENSE TERMS.

Your rights under this license automatically terminate if you violate any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use, modification, and distribution.

Rights may be reinstated only through written permission from the original licensor(s) or by a vote of the designated License Steward Council if multiple contributors exist.

## 8. Freedom Clause

This license shall not be interpreted to restrict:

Individual non-commercial users from studying or using the code in good faith.

Collectives engaged in building post-capitalist, post-scarcity, or emancipatory technologies.

The intent and spirit of this license is to protect and advance the development of the commons.

## 9. Versioning and Stewardship

This license is maintained by the originating developers and aligned revolutionary technologists, coordinated through cooperative governance mechanisms. Proposals for future amendments or variants may be submitted through collective stewardship platforms.

DPL is not OSI-approved and is incompatible with most capitalist-aligned open-source licenses. It deliberately forms a distinct ethical software commons.

A separate Governance Charter outlines:

The formation and operation of the License Steward Council.

Procedures for amendment votes and exemption review.

## 10. Optional Tiered Use Addendum (for strategic transition)

Instructors, researchers, or transitional developers operating within capitalist institutions may request limited-use exceptions for specific purposes:

Educational instruction.

Migration to non-capitalist infrastructure.

De-escalation from dependency on extractive systems.

These exemptions are granted only where:

No surplus value is extracted.

Use materially advances the commons.

Full transition to aligned infrastructure is a stated goal.

Use is reported and documented under the DPL exemption process.

## 11. Interpretive Principle

In case of ambiguity, this license shall be interpreted in favor of:

Preserving the software commons,

Deterring capitalist and militarist appropriation,

Upholding the values of emancipation, solidarity, and anti-exploitation.

## 12. Slogan (for public display)

“This software is not for profit. Not for war. Not for walls.It is for the people, the earth, and the future we must build together.”
