# Contradiction Engine – Spec v0.1
## 1 Purpose
Detect, model, and resolve dialectical contradictions in goals, plans, and world‑state to guide synthesis rather than binary conflict resolution.
## 2 Responsibilities
1. Build/maintain a
Contradiction Graph ( CG ) of entities, processes, and values.
2. Continuously quantify tension scores on each edge.
3. Propose feasible synthesis paths that sublate (preserve + negate + lift) opposing forces.
4. Expose analytics dashboards for governance review.
## 3 Key Concepts
Node | Any goal, value, agent, resource, or social group. | | Edge | A contradiction:
 {type: antagonistic |
 non‑antagonistic,
tension: float [0‑1], history: list} 
| | Synthesis Path | Ordered list of transformative actions that reduce net tension. |
## 4 API
detect_contradictions(goals: GoalSet, world_state: WorldState) -> ContradictionGraph
resolve_contradiction(c1: Node, c2: Node, strategy: str = "synthesis") -> SynthesisPlan
evaluate_praxis_outcome(plan: SynthesisPlan, feedback: FeedbackLog) -> ResolutionScore
5 Algorithms
•
Edge Update = EWMA of conflict signals (resource contention, value clashes).
•
Synthesis Search = A* on CG with heuristic h = Σ(tension) / feasibility.
•
Outcome Eval uses multi‑objective rewards (labor‑time, energy, class alignment).
6 Dependencies
•
Memory Service (for historical logs)
•
Forward World Model (for counterfactual testing)
7 Persistence
Graph stored in Neo4j; state snapshots every 5 min; full diff in MinIO.
9 Testing
•
Unit: synthetic contradiction cases.
•
Integration: run against commune‑sim scenario deck; assert Δtension < 0 over 10 steps.
10 Open Issues
•
Weighting antagonistic vs. non‑antagonistic contradictions.
•
Graph scaling beyond 10⁶ edges.
